            Today we  board a world or society where almost everything is connected to the net. Digital devices are substantially in trend nowadays. Today, almost as many devices are being made or there are many such devices around us, within which the employment of Internet of Things, computing, Image Processing and Machine Learning is increasing day by day and it's employed in other ways. is done. Many changes are made to such systems and are designed to attain more accurate results. the web of Things, computer science, Image Processing and Machine Learning are getting used today in many industries, hospitals, education, many places, making work easier and easier to try and do many things that humans cannot do can easily. Face Recognition System is used for attendance marking in schools, colleges, offices etc. the aim of using this method is to make a classroom attendance system for the workers working in companies/offices or students attending the classes of schools/colleges. in order that the face may be recognized and attendance will be made. The system is enacted to form a classroom attendance system that uses the concept of biometric identification as today's manual attendance systems become more time-consuming and cumbersome to keep up properly. and therefore, the probability of proxy presence becomes very high. Hence, such a system becomes highly needed. The project is developed in Python. within the project, the OpenCV library which has its own face recognition method and listening features using "Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) Algorithm". It uses "Haar Cascade Classifier" which is fast object detection which is an efficient object detection method. It works on machine learning which is trained from many positive and negative images of cascade function, then it's wont to detect objects in other images. After, this database has been employed in this, during this database the small print and photo of the scholar are kept. While taking attendance a student takes a photograph of the scholar and training is taken from this database which tells whether it's true or false information. Depletion of the tkinter is completed for the GUI Development. Many changes have been made to such systems and are designed to achieve more accurate results.

                The project pacts with the preservation of the attending details. the most determination of the system is pleasant the attendance of these who are present-day within the institutions, organizations, agencies, colleges, schools, universities etc. this technique will help the facilities for evaluating attendance of the contemporary individuals on the certain subject. because the appearances are used for face recognition, and is extremely much veering know-how technology for security, research, automation and plenty of more things. Computing technology term, that's wont to existence, size of external body part in a very particular photo. The software is clever enough to detect the facial expression and it also ignore other object like tree, building, etc. Face recognition could be a trending technology almost utilized in every area from security, research, automation and lots of more things. and that we are aiming and targeting on the attendance of the scholars by applying OpenCV and a few python inbuilt functionality. we've got also used text to speech library likewise. thanks to this pandemic all lectures are taking online mode. due to this student are taking advantage and making proxies. thanks to this many problems are creating. And thatâ€™s why we are making attendance management system using face recognition project to beat this type of problems. .It works during a 3x3 window because it shows 9-pixel values. Using each 3x3 window within the digital image, we are able to extract an LBP code. uses "Haar Cascade Classifier" which is fast object detection which is an efficient object detection method.
